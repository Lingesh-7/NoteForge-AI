# NoteForge-AI

NoteForge-AI is a multi-agent AI system that converts a syllabus into structured, exam-ready notes with unit-level questions and PDF export.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The system uses an agent-based workflow to:

```text
- Break syllabus into topics
- Retrieve relevant content (PDF or web)
- Generate structured notes
- Refine output using a critic loop
- Produce final notes with important questions
```
